Sudoku in Sinatra
=================

### Makers Academy Week 5 task

This task was set whilst learning to code at
[Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). The aim was to build my first
web app using [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) - a DSL for web services.

Evgeny Shadchev ([@shadchnev](http://twitter.com/shadchnev)) provided me with
instruction on how to set up Sinatra and the skeleton of this web app.

This web app could be improved by more integration tests and a more
sophisticated puzzle generator that would check there is only one solution to a
new puzzle.

I deployed this web app to  <a href="http://powerful-dawn-1640.herokuapp.com/">Heroku:</a>
